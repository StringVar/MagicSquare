In about 1510 Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa wrote De Occulta Philosophia, drawing 
on the Hermetic and magical works of Marsilio Ficino and Pico della Mirandola. 
In its 1531 edition, he expounded on the magical virtues of the seven magical 
squares of orders 3 to 9, each associated with one of the astrological planets, 
much in the same way as the older texts did. This book was very influential 
throughout Europe until the counter-reformation, and Agrippa's magic squares,
sometimes called kameas, continue to be used within modern ceremonial magic in
much the same way as he first prescribed.
